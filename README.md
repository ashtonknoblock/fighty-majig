# Description
Simple example of an express backend server with a separate frontend server

## Running the backend
Assuming you have node installed (`brew install node`), you should be able to do the following:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

## Running the frontend
You should just be able to open the `index.html` inside of the  `frontend` directory. If not, Try the folowing:
```bash
cd frontend
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

If you're using Python 3, you'll do this instead:
```bash
cd frontend
python -m http.server
```
